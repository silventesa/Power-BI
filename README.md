# Power BI project

This project was carried out in October 2020 in the context of the course Bouman 2.22 organized by BeCode, a network of inclusive coding bootcamps.

As data science learners, we were assigned a **use case** from the **Accenture** company, which provided us with a dataset belonging to the (fictitious) online food ordering platform Food On The Go (FOTG). 

The main goal of the project was to build a data report about FOTG's flow of orderings across day times by using [Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/).

## Who's there?

Three learners and collaborators elaborated the project contained in this repo: [Orhan Nurkan](https://github.com/orhannurkan), [Opap's Ditudidi](https://github.com/Cassik6) and [Sara Silvente](https://github.com/silventesa).

### Dataset

This dataset belongs to the (fictitious) **Food On The Go** company, an online meal ordering service. 

The data included information about the orderings made by costumers during the months of April and May 2017.

The dataset contains 7 csv files upon which a series of data relationships (view [this document](https://github.com/silventesa/accenture_usecase/blob/master/fotg_powerBI.pdf) for more details) were settled. The folder contains two versions, the original one (raw, provided by Accenture) and the modified one (cleaned, with which the report was performed).
