# Power BI project

This project was carried out in October 2020 by [Orhan Nurkan](https://github.com/orhannurkan), [Opap's Ditudidi](https://github.com/Cassik6) and [Sara Silvente](https://github.com/silventesa) in the context of the course Bouman 2.22 organized by BeCode, a network of inclusive coding bootcamps.

The project was originally a **use case** from the **Accenture** company. The main goal was to process data on orderings of a (fictitious) online food ordering platform, Food On The Go (FOTG), and build a report through the use of [Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/).

The data report provides valuable, visual-friendly information about FOTG's flow orderings across day times, which can be especially relevant for restaurateurs as well as for online platform holders.

### Dataset

This dataset belongs to the Food On The Go company, an online meal ordering service. 

The data included information about the orderings made by costumers during the months of April and May 2017.

The dataset contains 7 csv files upon which a series of data relationships (check [this document](https://github.com/silventesa/accenture_usecase/blob/master/fotg_powerBI.pdf) for more details) were settled. The folder contains two versions, the original one (raw, provided by Accenture) and the modified one (cleaned, with which the report was performed).
